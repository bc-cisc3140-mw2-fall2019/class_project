     This week the product team had come up with some changes in some designs. We had modified the project page 
that now includes buttons that allow the person who posted the project to either modify or delete a project
that has already been posted. We also had compiled all of our designs and uploaded them to GitHub. For next week we plan 
add a design where to user is able to post a new project on the site.
